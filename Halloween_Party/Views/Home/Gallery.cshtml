    <h4>Death Reaper</h4>
    <p>
        Death is frequently imagined as a personified force. In some mythologies, a character known as the Grim Reaper 
        (often depicted as a robed skeleton) causes the victim's death by coming to collect that person's soul. 
        Other beliefs hold that the Spectre of Death is only a psychopomp, serving to sever the last ties between the soul 
        and the body, and to guide the deceased to the afterlife, without having any control over when or how the victim dies. 
        Death is most often personified in male form, although in certain cultures Death is perceived as 
        female (for instance, Marzanna in Slavic mythology or Santa Muerte in Mexico).

    <h4>Zombie</h4>
    <p>
        A zombie (Haitian French: zombi, Haitian Creole: zonbi) is a mythological undead corporeal revenant created through 
        the reanimation of a corpse. Zombies are most commonly found in horror and fantasy genre works. The term comes from 
        Haitian folklore, in which a zombie is a dead body reanimated through various methods, most commonly magic like voodoo. 
        Modern media depictions of the reanimation of the dead often do not involve magic but rather science fictional methods 
        such as carriers, radiation, mental diseases, vectors, pathogens, parasites, scientific accidents, etc.

    <h4>Vampire</h4>
    <p>
        A vampire is a creature from folklore that subsists by feeding on the vital essence (generally in the form of blood) of 
        the living. In European folklore, vampires are undead creatures that often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths 
        in the neighbourhoods they inhabited while they were alive. They wore shrouds and were often described as bloated and of 
        ruddy or dark countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early 19th century.

    <h4>Werewolf</h4>
    <p>
        In folklore, a werewolf (Old English: werwulf, "man-wolf"), or occasionally 
        lycanthrope /ˈlaɪkənˌθroʊp/ (Greek: λυκάνθρωπος lukánthrōpos, "wolf-human"), is a human with the ability to shapeshift 
        into a wolf (or, especially in modern film, a therianthropic hybrid wolflike creature), either purposely or after being 
        placed under a curse or affliction (often a bite or scratch from another werewolf) with the transformations occurring on 
        the night of a full moon.
